In this task, Global Genes RareX Challenge committee provided with de-identified data (not downloadable) on patient populations in a flat table highlighting different phenotypes and genetic diagnoses. The task focused on expanding known phenotypes with previously unrecognized symptoms. We explore this data to determine if there are novel or underrecognized phenotypes correlated with specific rare diseases and submitted our results, approach and code.
